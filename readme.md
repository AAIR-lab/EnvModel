## Importing into Gazebo
Gazebo stores models in `~/.gazebo/models`. Copy and paste the folders for each model into `~/.gazebo/models`. You should see the model in the gazebo library afterwards. 

## Tweaking the model
The models were created using Autodesk Fusion 360, which is freely available for students and educators. If you would like to make tweaks to the models, the original files can be found in the `original_assets` folder.
